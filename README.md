# challenge-10-oo-team-profile-generator

## Created a portfolio showcasing my works

# Made with Node.js, Inquirer, HTML and testing by Jest

# Creating a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

# Learned how to use Inquirer to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. Testing modules with Jest to ensure that all unit tests pass.
